<h2>FAQ</h2>

<h3>A. Eligibility</h3>

<div id="collapse-a-zh-trad">
<h4>A1. What is the eligibility for applying funding support from the BUD Fund?</h4>

<div>
<p>Answer</p>

<p>The eligibility of applicants includes: <br />
a. Registered in Hong Kong under the Business Registration Ordinance (Chapter 310), <br />
b. Non-listed company, and<br />
 c. With substantive business operations in Hong Kong.</p>

<p>With substantive business operations means that the applicants have actual operations and business transactions. In consideration of this, reference will be made to a basket of factors in respect of the applicant including type of business operations in Hong Kong, number of employees in Hong Kong, information of customers/ clients and whether profits are tax assessable in Hong Kong. A shell company or an enterprise having most of its main business operations outside Hong Kong will not be regarded as having substantive business operations in Hong Kong.</p>

<p>The applicant has to submit the application form together with relevant documentary proof of substantive business operations in Hong Kong as below: <br />
a. Employees ’ records; <br />
b. Financial records; <br />
c. Business transactions/operations information (e.g. business contracts, invoice, shipping documents, records of stock purchased and goods sold etc).</p>

<p>(For details of the above documentary proof, please refer to the Guide to Application.)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
</div>

<h4>A2. Are non-listed Hong Kong companies which are subsidiaries of a listed parent company (in or outsider Hong Kong) eligible for applying this funding support?</h4>

<div>
<p>Answer:</p>

<p>Listed parent company and its non-listed subsidiary companies are separate legal entities. Accordingly, despite the parent company is listed in or outside Hong Kong, its subsidiary companies are eligible for this funding support as long as they are non-listed companies in and outside Hong Kong, registered in Hong Kong under the Business Registration Ordinance (Chapter 310) and have substantive business operations in Hong Kong.</p>
</div>

<h4>A3. Is this funding support open for SMEs only?</h4>

<div>
<p>Answer:</p>

<p>This funding support is not only open for SMEs. Enterprises which are non-listed companies, registered in Hong Kong under the Business Registration Ordinance (Chapter 310) and having substantive business operations in Hong Kong are eligible for applying this funding support.</p>
</div>

<h4>A4. What industries are eligible for applying this funding support?</h4>

<div>
<p>Answer:</p>

<p>There is no limitation on industry sectors for applying the funding support. The projects under applications need to achieve the target of exploring and developing the Mainland China market through developing brands, upgrading &amp; restructuring business operations and/or promoting sales in the Mainland China.</p>
</div>

<h4>A5. Are enterprises that currently do not have business operations in the Mainland China eligible for applying this funding support?</h4>

<div>
<p>Answer:</p>

<p>Enterprises that do not have business or operations in the Mainland China at the time of application are still eligible for applying the funding support provided that they are registered in Hong Kong under the Business Registration Ordinance (Chapter 310), non-listed and having substantive business operations in Hong Kong.</p>
</div>

<h4>A6. Why are listed companies not eligible for this funding programme? Are companies listed on the Growth Enterprise Market (GEM) or foreign trading market eligible for the application?</h4>

<div>
<p>Answer:</p>

<p>The BUD Fund aims to provide funding support to individual Hong Kong enterprises in undertaking projects to develop brands, upgrade and restructure their business operations and/or promote sales in the Mainland China for exploring and developing the Mainland China market. As listed companies have more funds raising channels for selection, all the listed companies, including those listed on Hong Kong Main Board and GEM, whether in or outside Hong Kong, are not eligible for the application in order to enable enterprises that have actual needs can benefit from the Programme.</p>
</div>

<h4>A7. If the enterprise company is a listed in the Mainland China and has a subsidiary company that is non-listed and registered in Hong Kong, can the subsidiary company apply this funding support for implementing the project for its parent company (listed company) in the Mainland China?</h4>

<div>
<p>Answer:</p>

<p>If the project is implemented for the listed company in the Mainland China, since listed companies have more funds raising channels for selection, the applications are not eligible. This can enable more enterprises that have actual needs benefit from the Programme.</p>
</div>
</div>

<h3>B. Grant Details</h3>

<div id="collapse-b-zh-trad">
<h4>B1. Can the enterprise submit another funding application before the completion of an ongoing project funded by the Programme?</h4>

<div>
<p>Answer:</p>

<p>The enterprise can submit another funding application before the completion of an ongoing project funded by the Programme, if the total number of projects and the accumulative funding amount approved are less than the corresponding caps (10 approved projects with cumulative funding ceiling of HK$1,000,000). The applicant is required to provide relevant information of the approved projects (including the project title, approved funding amount and project duration etc.) on the application form.</p>

<p>The enterprise should note that the project progress or performance of the previously approved projects may affect the vetting results of their new applications. The Programme Management Committee will also assess the applications case by case by considering the necessity and capability of the applicant in managing different projects simultaneously.</p>
</div>

<h4>B2. Can eligible enterprises apply for the funding support from the BUD Fund for the ongoing projects that are being undertaken by them?</h4>

<div>
